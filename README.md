# Node.js QR Code Generator

This programme is a QR code generator which uses 3 npm packages. The user is prompted for an input, which should be a URL, using the 'inquirer' npm package. The input is validated using the 'is-url-http' npm package. The input is then stored in a txt file, and a QR code in png format is generated using the 'qr-image' npm package.
